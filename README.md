# dateRange
GOAL - to create a date calculator, "how many days from?" as an example.

Work in Progress Issues
- some months have 30 days
- leap years
- add string support, Month: May
- add error message and loop back to correct input, "Month: 13": "Incorrect input, please use number 1-12". 
  - String support here
